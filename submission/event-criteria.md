# Event criteria

Event based applications for CHAOSS Badging would be evaluated differently than Projects. Likely, not all metrics defined as Event related metrics will be valid for all applying events.

Applicants choose the set of metrics which best apply, and this is double-checked by a reviewer.

## First metric set - local

### Metrics

- Code of Conduct at Event
- Speaker Demographics

These would form the essential metrics for every criteria and would be the minimum requirement for all Event applications in D&I Badging. This would apply to small scale local events.


## Second metric set - regional

### Metrics

- Code of Conduct at event
- Speaker Demographics
- Attendee demographics

### Synopsis
These are likely to be the metrics which can be used in regional level events. These can be Events which are central to a region (multiple states) but are not held on a national level.


## Third metric set - national

### Metrics

- Code of conduct at event
- Speaker Demographics
- Attendee Demographics
- Diversity Access Tickets

### Synopsis
National events are very large, but their scope of attendees does not include multiple nations. One exception is made for events that are near a national border.


## Fourth metric set - multinational

### Metrics

- Code of Conduct at event
- Speaker Demographics
- Attendee Demographics
- Diversity Access Tickets
- Family friendliness

### Synopsis

Family friendlness is generally included in large scale events. It makes sense with all the other metrics since these criterias tend to be fulfilled as well.
