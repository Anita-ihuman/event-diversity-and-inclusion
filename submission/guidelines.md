# CHAOSS Badging Event submission guidelines

- Make sure all the [requirements](./requirements.md) are fulfilled before initiating a CHAOSS Badging application.
- Timely integrate reviewers' feedback while the CHAOSS Badging application is being evaluated.

## Application guide
1. Create a fork of [event-diversity-and-inclusion](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) repository
2. Append an entry to the table in the README in a separate branch
3. Create a PR to project-diversity-and-inclusion `master` branch to add your proposed changes.
4. Fill out the PR template with required details.
5. The application process starts when PR is opened.
6. Communicate with the reviewers during the process and provide Event information according to the metrics you committed to
7. The review ends when all required metric checks are satisfied.
   When either of these conditions are met, the moderator suggests the approprite badge for the Event through a PR suggestion.
   This suggestion can be applied directly in the form of a commit. Make sure to add the PR link as well.
8. The whole process ends when the PR with the Badge is added to the master branch.
